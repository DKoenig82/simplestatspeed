# Simple Stat Speed
Is a Apple Chips (M1 or higher) Mac App

## Description

The SimpleStatSpeed shows the currently used CPU in percent, the used RAM in percent and the download/upload speed in the menu bar. I want a status mini app that, above all, displays the said data in a large and legible way. You can decide for yourself what you want to see of the three characteristics. The app is in English and free updates are provided.

Features:  CPU in percent,  RAM in percent,  Download/Upload Velocity,  Dropdown Menu with more info, and much more ...
Tipp: Put the app in the dock and right click on the app icon, choose options and then - Open at login and the app will start every time you start macOS.

‼️ You need a Apple Chips M1 or higher Mac.
